	title = {Failure modes and downtime of radiotherapy linear accelerators and {Multi}-{Leaf} {Collimators} in {Indonesia}},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.08906},
	abstract = {The lack of equitable access to radiotherapy linear accelerators (LINACs) is a substantial barrier to cancer care in Low and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs). Aside from the issue of cost, there are also issues of robustness of state-of-the-art LINACs in LMICs, which are subject to mechanical and electrical breakdowns, which can result in downtimes ranging from days to months. Recent research has identified disparities in failure frequency and downtimes between LMICs (Nigeria, Botswana) and a High-Income Countries (HIC, the UK), and highlighted the need for additional data and study particularly relating to Multi-Leaf Collimators (MLCs). This study analyses data from 14 Indonesian Hospitals with a total of 19 LINACs, and shows the pathways to failure of radiotherapy LINACs and frequency of breakdowns with an additional focus on the Multi-Leaf Collimator (MLC) subsystem. We found that LINACs through Indonesia are down for 7 times longer than HICs and the Mean Time Between Failures of a LINAC in Indonesia is 341.58 Hours, or about 14 days. Furthermore, of the LINACs with an MLC fitted, \$59.02{\textasciicircum}\{+1.98\}\_\{-1.61\}\$\% of mechanical faults are due to the MLC and \$57.14{\textasciicircum}\{+0.78\}\_\{-1.27\}\$\% of the time a component needs to be replaced, it is related to the MLC. These results outline the need to reassess the current generation of RT LINACs and ultimately work towards guiding future designs to be robust enough for all environments.},

	abstract = {The accuracy of superficial dose calculations for breast cancer treatments with Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy (VMAT) is of major importance. For target volumes close to the surface, the inverse dosimetric planning can lead to very high fluences in the build-up region to properly cover the volume to be treated. Various radiotherapy modalities are currently used in parallel with additional protocols to enable a better control on the dose delivery (bolus, target volume margins). One of the difficulties currently facing medical physicists is the lack of available tools to test the impact of these different solutions on the superficial dose distribution. We present a new open source toolkit to assist medical physicists in evaluating the 3D distributions of superficial dose in VMAT breast cancer treatments. This tool is based on the GATE Monte Carlo software, a Geant4 application dedicated to medical physics. A set of macros has been developed to simulate in an easy way a full VMAT plan from the information available in the DICOM-RT files (image, plan, structure and dose). The toolkit has been tested on a 6 MV Varian NovalisTx™ accelerator. The paper presents a precise comparison of 3D surface dose distributions from experimental measurements (EBT3 films), TPS (Varian Eclipse) and Monte Carlo simulation (GATE). The comparison made it possible to highlight both the TPS biases for the surface dose calculation and the good performances of the developed toolkit. The simulation of surface dose distributions on a real patient has also been performed to illustrate the potential clinical applications.},

	abstract = {Purpose In radiation therapy, x-ray dose must be precisely sculpted to the tumor, while simultaneously avoiding surrounding organs at risk. This requires modulation of x-ray intensity in space and/or time. Typically, this is achieved using a multi leaf collimator (MLC)—a complex mechatronic device comprising over one hundred individually powered tungsten ‘leaves’ that move in or out of the radiation field as required. Here, an all-electronic x-ray collimation concept with no moving parts is presented, termed “SPHINX”: Scanning Pencil-beam High-speed Intensity-modulated X-ray source. SPHINX utilizes a spatially distributed bremsstrahlung target and collimator array in conjunction with magnetic scanning of a high energy electron beam to generate a plurality of small x-ray “beamlets.” Methods A simulation framework was developed in Topas Monte Carlo incorporating a phase space electron source, transport through user defined magnetic fields, bremsstrahlung x-ray production, transport through a SPHINX collimator, and dose in water. This framework was completely parametric, meaning a simulation could be built and run for any supplied geometric parameters. This functionality was coupled with Bayesian optimization to find the best parameter set based on an objective function which included terms to maximize dose rate for a user defined beamlet width while constraining inter-channel cross talk and electron contamination. Designs for beamlet widths of 5, 7, and 10 mm2 were generated. Each optimization was run for 300 iterations and took approximately 40 h on a 24-core computer. For the optimized 7-mm model, a simulation of all beamlets in water was carried out including a linear scanning magnet calibration simulation. Finally, a back-of-envelope dose rate formalism was developed and used to estimate dose rate under various conditions. Results The optimized 5–, 7–, and 10-mm models had beamlet widths of 5.1 , 7.2 , and 10.1 mm2 and dose rates of 3574, 6351, and 10 015 Gy/C, respectively. The reduction in dose rate for smaller beamlet widths is a result of both increased collimation and source occlusion. For the simulation of all beamlets in water, the scanning magnet calibration reduced the offset between the collimator channels and beam centroids from 2.9 ±1.9 mm to 0.01 ±0.03 mm. A slight reduction in dose rate of approximately 2\% per degree of scanning angle was observed. Based on a back-of-envelope dose rate formalism, SPHINX in conjunction with next-generation linear accelerators has the potential to achieve substantially higher dose rates than conventional MLC-based delivery, with delivery of an intensity modulated 100 × 100 mm2 field achievable in 0.9 to 10.6 s depending on the beamlet widths used. Conclusions Bayesian optimization was coupled with Monte Carlo modeling to generate SPHINX geometries for various beamlet widths. A complete Monte Carlo simulation for one of these designs was developed, including electron beam transport of all beamlets through scanning magnets, x-ray production and collimation, and dose in water. These results demonstrate that SPHINX is a promising candidate for sculpting radiation dose with no moving parts, and has the potential to vastly improve both the speed and robustness of radiotherapy delivery. A multi-beam SPHINX system may be a candidate for delivering magavoltage FLASH RT in humans.},

Recently, image-guided dose painting (DP) radiotherapy has emerged as a promising strategy to increase local control rates. In this study, we evaluate the practical application of a multiparametric MRI model of glioma infiltration for DP radiotherapy in GBM by measuring its conformity, feasibility, and expected clinical benefits against standard of care treatment.Maps of tumor probability were generated from perfusion/diffusion MRI data from 17 GBM patients via a previously developed model of GBM infiltration. Prescriptions for DP were linearly derived from tumor probability maps and used to develop dose optimized treatment plans. Conformity of DP plans to dose prescriptions was measured via a quality factor. Feasibility of DP plans was evaluated by dose metrics to target volumes and critical brain structures. Expected clinical benefit of DP plans was assessed by tumor control probability. The DP plans were compared to standard radiotherapy plans.The conformity of the DP plans was \&gt;90\%. Compared to the standard plans, DP (1) did not affect dose delivered to organs at risk; (2) increased mean and maximum dose and improved minimum dose coverage for the target volumes; (3) reduced minimum dose within the radiotherapy treatment margins; (4) improved local tumor control probability within the target volumes for all patients.A multiparametric MRI model of GBM infiltration can enable conformal, feasible, and potentially beneficial dose painting radiotherapy plans.},

	abstract = {Proton therapy and MRI-Linacs are two of the most exciting and fast growing technologies in radiation oncology. With over 100 MRI-Linacs and 100 proton therapy centres either in operation or under construction, an integrated approach that brings together the excellent soft tissue imaging of MRI with the superior dose conformity of proton therapy is compelling. The promise of MRI-guided proton therapy has prompted multiple research studies and the building of two pre-clinical experimental systems, taking us closer to realisation of this technology. Patients who would benefit most are those whose cancers have substantial tumour motion or anatomical variation, and those who are currently unable to receive safe dose-escalation due to nearby critical structures. MRI-guided proton therapy could allow more patients with pancreatic cancer, central lung cancer and oligo-metastatic cancers in the upper abdomen (e.g. liver and adrenal) to safely receive escalated curative doses. Head and neck, lung, brain and cervix cancers, where treatment accuracy is affected by inter-fraction tumour changes such as tumour regression or changing oedema, or normal anatomy variations, would also benefit from MRI-guidance. There will be new options to improve cure by functional MRI-guided biologically adapted proton therapy. This review focuses on the clinical aspects of MRI-guided proton therapy. We describe the clinical challenges in proton therapy and the clinical benefits from the addition of MRI-guidance. We provide updates on the design and beam modelling of in-line and perpendicular MRI-guided proton therapy systems, and a roadmap to clinical implementation.},

	abstract = {MRI can help to categorize tissues as malignant or non-malignant both anatomically and functionally, with a high level of spatial and temporal resolution. This non-invasive imaging modality has been integrated with radiotherapy in devices that can differentially target the most aggressive and resistant regions of tumours. The past decade has seen the clinical deployment of treatment devices that combine imaging with targeted irradiation, making the aspiration of integrated MRI-guided radiotherapy (MRIgRT) a reality. The two main clinical drivers for the adoption of MRIgRT are the ability to image anatomical changes that occur before and during treatment in order to adapt the treatment approach, and to image and target the biological features of each tumour. Using motion management and biological targeting, the radiation dose delivered to the tumour can be adjusted during treatment to improve the probability of tumour control, while simultaneously reducing the radiation delivered to non-malignant tissues, thereby reducing the risk of treatment-related toxicities. The benefits of this approach are expected to increase survival and quality of life. In this Review, we describe the current state of MRIgRT, and the opportunities and challenges of this new radiotherapy approach.},

	abstract = {Purpose
While disparities in the inclusion and advancement of women and minorities in science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and medical fields have been well documented, less work has focused on medical physics specifically. In this study, we evaluate historical and current diversity within the medical physics workforce, in cohorts representative of professional advancement (PA) in the field, and within National Institutes of Health (NIH)–funded medical physics research activities.
Methods and Materials
The 2020 American Association of Physicists in Medicine (AAPM) membership was queried as surrogate for the medical physics workforce. Select subsets of the AAPM membership were queried as surrogate for PA and early career professional advancement (ECPA) in medical physics. Self-reported AAPM-member demographics data representative of study analysis groups were identified and analyzed. Demographic characteristics of the 2020 AAPM membership were compared with those of the PA and ECPA cohorts and United States (US) population. The AAPM-NIH Research Database was appended with principal investigator (PI) demographics data and analyzed to evaluate trends in grant allocation by PI demographic characteristics.
Results
Women, Hispanic/Latinx/Spanish individuals, and individuals reporting a race other than White or Asian alone comprised 50.8\%, 18.7\%, and 32.4\% of the US population, respectively, but only 23.9\%, 9.1\%, and 7.9\% of the 2020 AAPM membership, respectively. In general, representation of women and minorities was further decreased in the PA cohort; however, significantly higher proportions of women (P {\textless} .001) and Hispanic/Latinx/Spanish members (P {\textless} .05) were observed in the ECPA cohort than the 2020 AAPM membership. Analysis of historical data revealed modest increases in diversity within the AAPM membership since 2002. Across NIH grants awarded to AAPM members between 1985 and 2020, only 9.4\%, 5.3\%, and 1.7\% were awarded to women, Hispanic/Latinx/Spanish, and non-White, non-Asian PIs, respectively.
Conclusions
Diversity within medical physics is limited. Proactive policy should be implemented to ensure diverse, equitable, and inclusive representation within research activities, roles representative of PA, and the profession at large.},

Beginning in 1992, MINC was developed as a system for flexible, self-documenting representation of neuroscientific imaging data with arbitrary orientation and dimensionality. The MINC system incorporates three broad components: a file format specification, a programming library, and a growing set of tools. In the early 2000's the MINC developers created MINC 2.0, which added support for 64-bit file sizes, internal compression, and a number of other modern features. Because of its extensible design, it has been easy to incorporate details of provenance in the header metadata, including an explicit processing history, unique identifiers, and vendor-specific scanner settings. This makes MINC ideal for use in large scale imaging studies and databases. It also makes it easy to adapt to new scanning sequences and modalities.},

	abstract = {Purpose To describe a model-based reconstruction strategy for routine magnetic resonance imaging that accounts for gradient nonlinearity (GNL) during rather than after transformation to the image domain, and demonstrate that this approach reduces the spatial resolution loss that occurs during strictly image-domain GNL-correction. Methods After reviewing conventional GNL-correction methods, we propose a generic signal model for GNL-affected magnetic resonance imaging acquisitions, discuss how it incorporates into contemporary image reconstruction platforms, and describe efficient nonuniform fast Fourier transform-based computational routines for these. The impact of GNL-correction on spatial resolution by the conventional and proposed approaches is investigated on phantom data acquired at varying offsets from gradient isocenter, as well as on fully sampled and (retrospectively) undersampled in vivo acquisitions. Results Phantom results demonstrate that resolution loss that occurs during GNL-correction is significantly less for the proposed strategy than for the standard approach at distances {\textgreater}10 cm from isocenter with a 35 cm field-of-view gradient coil. The in vivo results suggest that the proposed strategy better preserves fine anatomical detail than retrospective GNL-correction while offering comparable geometric correction. Conclusion Accounting for GNL during image reconstruction allows geometric distortion to be corrected with less spatial resolution loss than is typically observed with the conventional image domain correction strategy.

The problem is presented in terms of first principles, and a correction method based on a gradient field spherical harmonic expansion is proposed. In our case, the amount of distortion measured within a typical field of view (FOV) required for head imaging is sufficiently large that without the use of some distortion correction technique, the images would be of limited use for stereotaxy or longitudinal studies, where precise volumetric information is required.},

	abstract = {Image distortion is an important consideration in the use of magnetic resonance (MR) images for radiotherapy planning. The distortion is a consequence of system distortion (arising from main magnetic ﬁeld inhomogeneity and nonlinearities in the applied magnetic ﬁeld gradients) and of effects arising from the object/patient being imaged. A two-stage protocol has been developed to correct both system- and object-induced distortion in pelvic images which incorporates measures to maintain the quality, accuracy and consistency of the imaging and correction procedures. The ﬁrst stage of the correction procedure is described here and involves the removal of system distortion. Object- (patient-) induced effects will be described in a subsequent work. Images are acquired with the patient lying on a ﬂat rigid bed, which reproduces treatment conditions. A frame of marker tubes surrounding the patient and attached to the bed provides quality assurance data in each image. System distortions in the three orthogonal planes are mapped using a separate phantom, which ﬁts closely within the quality control frame. Software has been written which automates the measurement and checking of the many marker positions which the test objects generate and which ensures that patient data are acquired using a consistent imaging protocol. Results are presented which show that the scanner and the phantoms used in measuring distortion give highly reproducible results with mean changes of the order of 0.1 mm between repeated measurements of marker positions in the same imaging session. Effective correction for in-plane components of system distortion is demonstrated.},

	abstract = {Purpose The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-Linac system combines a MRI scanner and a linear accelerator (Linac) to realize real-time localization and adaptive radiotherapy for tumors. Given that the Australian MRI-Linac system has a 30-cm diameter of spherical volume (DSV) with a shimmed homogeneity of ±4.05 parts per million (ppm), a gradient nonlinearity (GNL) of {\textless}5\% can only be assured within 15 cm from the system's isocenter. GNL increases from the isocenter and escalates close to and outside of the edge of the DSV. Gradient nonlinearity can cause large geometric distortions, which may provide inaccurate tumor localization and potentially degrade the radiotherapy treatment. In this study, we aimed to characterize and correct the geometric distortions both inside and outside of the DSV. Methods On the basis of phantom measurements, an inverse electromagnetic (EM) method was developed to reconstitute the virtual current density distribution that could generate gradient fields. The obtained virtual EM source was capable of characterizing the GNL field both inside and outside of the DSV. With the use of this GNL field information, our recently developed “GNL-encoding” reconstruction method was applied to correct the distortions implemented in the k-space domain. Results Both phantom and in vivo human images were used to validate the proposed method. The results showed that the maximal displacements within an imaging volume of 30 cm × 30 cm × 30 cm after using the fifth-order spherical harmonic (SH) method and the proposed method were 6.1 ± 0.6 mm and 1.8 ± 0.6 mm, respectively. Compared with the fifth-order SH-based method, the new solution decreased the percentage of markers (within an imaging volume of 30 cm × 30 cm × 30 cm) with ≥1.5-mm distortions from 6.3\% to 1.3\%, indicating substantially improved geometric accuracy. Conclusions The experimental results indicated that the proposed method could provide substantially improved geometric accuracy for the region outside of the DSV, when comparing with the fifth-order SH-based method.},

	abstract = {Purpose The hybrid system combining a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner with a linear accelerator (Linac) has become increasingly desirable for tumor treatment because of excellent soft tissue contrast and nonionizing radiation. However, image distortions caused by gradient nonlinearity (GNL) can have detrimental impacts on real-time radiotherapy using MRI-Linac systems, where accurate geometric information of tumors is essential. Methods In this work, we proposed a deep convolutional neural network-based method to efficiently recover undistorted images (ReUINet) for real-time image guidance. The ReUINet, based on the encoder-decoder structure, was created to learn the relationship between the undistorted images and distorted images. The ReUINet was pretrained and tested on a publically available brain MR image dataset acquired from 23 volunteers. Then, transfer learning was adopted to implement the pretrained model (i.e., network with optimal weights) on the experimental three-dimensional (3D) grid phantom and in-vivo pelvis image datasets acquired from the 1.0 T Australian MRI-Linac system. Results Evaluations on the phantom (768 slices) and pelvis data (88 slices) showed that the ReUINet achieved improvement over 15 times and 45 times on computational efficiency in comparison with standard interpolation and GNL-encoding methods, respectively. Moreover, qualitative and quantitative results demonstrated that the ReUINet provided better correction results than the standard interpolation method, and comparable performance compared to the GNL-encoding approach. Conclusions Validated by simulation and experimental results, the proposed ReUINet showed promise in obtaining accurate MR images for the implementation of real-time MRI-guided radiotherapy.},

The gradient nonlinearity (GNL)-induced distortions in MRI, however, hinder the implementation of MRI-Linac system in image-guided radiotherapy where highly accurate geometry and anatomy of the target tumor is indispensable. Methods To correct the geometric distortions in MR images, in particular, for the 1 Tesla (T) MRI-Linac system, a deep fully connected neural network was proposed to automatically learn the intricate relationship between the undistorted (theoretical) and distorted (real) space. A dataset, consisting of spatial samples acquired by phantom measurement that covers both inside and outside the working diameter of spherical volume (DSV), was utilized for training the neural network, which offers the ability to describe subtle deviations of the GNL field within the entire region of interest (ROI). Results The performance of the proposed method was evaluated on MR images of a three-dimensional (3D) phantom and the pelvic region of an adult volunteer scanned in the 1T MRI-Linac system. The experimental results showed that the severe geometric distortions within the entire ROI had been successfully corrected with an error less than the pixel size. Also, the presented network is highly efficient, which achieved significant improvement in terms of computational efficiency compared to existing methods. Conclusions The feasibility of the presented deep neural network for characterizing the GNL field deviations in the 1T MRI-Linac system was demonstrated in this study, which shows promise in facilitating the MRI-Linac system to be routinely implemented in real-time MRI-guided radiotherapy.},

	abstract = {With the utilization of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in radiotherapy increasing, routine quality assurance (QA) of these systems is necessary. The assessment of geometric distortion in images used for radiotherapy treatment planning needs to be quantified and monitored over time. This work presents an adaptable methodology for performing routine QA for systematic MRI geometric distortion. A software tool and compatible protocol (designed to work with any CT and MR compatible phantom on any scanner) were developed to quantify geometric distortion via deformable image registration. The MR image is deformed to the CT, generating a deformation field, which is sampled, quantifying geometric distortion as a function of distance from scanner isocenter. Configurability of the QA tool was tested, and results compared to those provided from commercial solutions. Registration accuracy was investigated by repeating the deformable registration step on the initial deformed MR image to define regions with residual distortions. The geometric distortion of four clinical systems was quantified using the customisable QA method presented. Maximum measured distortions varied from 2.2 to 19.4 mm (image parameter and sampling volume dependent). The workflow was successfully customized for different phantom configurations and volunteer imaging studies. Comparison to a vendor supplied solution showed good agreement in regions where the two procedures were sampling the same imaging volume. On a large field of view phantom across various scanners, the QA tool accurately quantified geometric distortions within 17–22 cm from scanner isocenter. Beyond these regions, the geometric integrity of images in clinical applications should be considered with a higher degree of uncertainty due to increased gradient nonlinearity and B0 inhomogeneity. This tool has been successfully integrated into routine QA of the MRI scanner utilized for radiotherapy within our department. It enables any low susceptibility MR-CT compatible phantom to quantify the geometric distortion on any MRI scanner with a configurable, user friendly interface for ease of use and consistency in data collection and analysis.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Distortions in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) compromise spatial fidelity, potentially impacting delineation and dose calculation. We characterized 2D and 3D large field of view (FOV), sequence-independent distortion at various positions in a 1.0 T high-field open MR simulator (MR-SIM) to implement correction maps for MRI treatment planning.
METHODS: A 36 × 43 × 2 cm(3) phantom with 255 known landmarks (∼1 mm(3)) was scanned using 1.0 T high-field open MR-SIM at isocenter in the transverse, sagittal, and coronal axes, and a 465 × 350 × 168 mm(3) 3D phantom was scanned by stepping in the superior-inferior direction in three overlapping positions to achieve a total 465 × 350 × 400 mm(3) sampled FOV yielding {\textgreater}13 800 landmarks (3D Gradient-Echo, TE/TR/α = 5.54 ms/30 ms/28°, voxel size = 1 × 1 × 2 mm(3)). A binary template (reference) was generated from a phantom schematic. An automated program converted MR images to binary via masking, thresholding, and testing for connectivity to identify landmarks. Distortion maps were generated by centroid mapping. Images were corrected via warping with inverse distortion maps, and temporal stability was assessed.
RESULTS: Over the sampled FOV, non-negligible residual gradient distortions existed as close as 9.5 cm from isocenter, with a maximum distortion of 7.4 mm as close as 23 cm from isocenter. Over six months, average gradient distortions were -0.07 ± 1.10 mm and 0.10 ± 1.10 mm in the x and y directions for the transverse plane, 0.03 ± 0.64 and -0.09 ± 0.70 mm in the sagittal plane, and 0.4 ± 1.16 and 0.04 ± 0.40 mm in the coronal plane. After implementing 3D correction maps, distortions were reduced to {\textless}1 pixel width (1 mm) for all voxels up to 25 cm from magnet isocenter.
CONCLUSIONS: Inherent distortion due to gradient nonlinearity was found to be non-negligible even with vendor corrections applied, and further corrections are required to obtain 1 mm accuracy for large FOVs. Statistical analysis of temporal stability shows that sequence independent distortion maps are consistent within six months of characterization.},

However, it is recognized that MR images suffer from scanner‐related and object‐induced distortions that may lead to an incorrect placement of anatomical structures. This subsequently may result in reduced accuracy in delivering treatment dose fractions in RTP. To accomplish the accurate representation of anatomical targets required by RTP, distortions must be mapped and the images rectified before being used in the clinical process. In this work, we investigate a novel, phantom‐based method that determines and corrects for 3D system‐related distortions. The algorithm consists of two key components: an adaptive control point identification and registration tool and an iterative method that finds the best estimate of 3D distortion.

	abstract = {Objective
To develop a method for the assessment and characterization of 3D geometric distortion as part of routine quality assurance for MRI scanners commissioned for Radiation Therapy planning.
Materials and methods
In this study, the in-plane and through-plane geometric distortions on a 1.5T GE MRI-SIM unit are characterized and the 2D and 3D correction algorithms provided by the vendor are evaluated. We used a phantom developed by GE Healthcare that covers a large field of view of 500mm, and consists of layers of foam embedded with a matrix of ellipsoidal markers. An in-house Java-based software module was developed to automatically assess the geometric distortion by calculating the center of each marker using the center of mass method, correcting of gross rotation errors and comparing the corrected positions with a CT gold standard data set. Spatial accuracy of typical pulse sequences used in RT planning was assessed (2D T1/T2 FSE, 3D CUBE, T1 SPGR) using the software. The accuracy of vendor specific geometric distortion correction (GDC) algorithms was quantified by measuring distortions before and after the application of the 2D and 3D correction algorithms.
Results
Our algorithm was able to accurately calculate geometric distortion with sub-pixel precision. For all typical MR sequences used in Radiotherapy, the vendor’s GDC was able to substantially reduce the distortions. Our results showed also that the impact of the acquisition produced a maximum variation of 0.2mm over a radial distance of 200mm. It has been shown that while the 2D correction algorithm remarkably reduces the in-plane geometric distortion, 3D geometric distortion further reduced the geometric distortion by correcting both in-plane and through-plane distortions in all acquisitions.
Conclusion
The presented methods represent a valuable tool for routine quality assurance of MR applications that require stringent spatial accuracy assessment such as radiotherapy. The phantom used in this study provides three dimensional arrays of control points. These tools and the detailed results can be also used for developing new geometric distortion correction algorithms or improving the existing ones.},

	abstract = {Purpose To describe a model-based reconstruction strategy for routine magnetic resonance imaging that accounts for gradient nonlinearity (GNL) during rather than after transformation to the image domain, and demonstrate that this approach reduces the spatial resolution loss that occurs during strictly image-domain GNL-correction. Methods After reviewing conventional GNL-correction methods, we propose a generic signal model for GNL-affected magnetic resonance imaging acquisitions, discuss how it incorporates into contemporary image reconstruction platforms, and describe efficient nonuniform fast Fourier transform-based computational routines for these. The impact of GNL-correction on spatial resolution by the conventional and proposed approaches is investigated on phantom data acquired at varying offsets from gradient isocenter, as well as on fully sampled and (retrospectively) undersampled in vivo acquisitions. Results Phantom results demonstrate that resolution loss that occurs during GNL-correction is significantly less for the proposed strategy than for the standard approach at distances {\textgreater}10 cm from isocenter with a 35 cm field-of-view gradient coil. The in vivo results suggest that the proposed strategy better preserves fine anatomical detail than retrospective GNL-correction while offering comparable geometric correction. Conclusion Accounting for GNL during image reconstruction allows geometric distortion to be corrected with less spatial resolution loss than is typically observed with the conventional image domain correction strategy.

	abstract = {The work presented herein describes our methods and results for predicting, measuring and correcting geometric distortions in a clinical magnetic resonance (MR) scanner for the purpose of image guidance in radiation treatment planning. Geometric inaccuracies due to both inhomogeneities in the background field and nonlinearities in the applied gradients were easily visualized on the MR images of a regularly structured three-dimensional (3D) grid phantom. From a computed tomography scan, the locations of just under control points within the phantom were accurately determined in three dimensions using a MATLAB-based computer program. MR distortion was then determined by measuring the corresponding locations of the control points when the phantom was imaged using the MR scanner. Using a reversed gradient method, distortions due to gradient nonlinearities were separated from distortions due to inhomogeneities in the background field. Because the various sources of machine-related distortions can be individually characterized, distortions present in other imaging sequences (for which 3D distortion cannot accurately be measured using phantom methods) can be predicted negating the need for individual distortion calculation for a variety of other imaging sequences. Distortions were found to be primarily caused by gradient nonlinearities and maximum image distortions were reported to be less than those previously found by other researchers at . Finally, the image slices were corrected for distortion in order to provide geometrically accurate phantom images.},

	abstract = {MR images are known to be distorted because of both gradient nonlinearity and imperfections in the B0 field, the latter caused either by an imperfect shim or sample-induced distortions. This paper describes in detail a method for correcting the gradient warp distortion, based on a direct field mapping using a custom-built phantom with three orthogonal grids of fluid-filled rods. The key advance of the current work over previous contributions is the large volume of the mapping phantom and the large distortions ({\textgreater}25 mm) corrected, making the method suitable for use with large field of view, extra-cranial images. Experimental measurements on the Siemens AS25 gradient set, as installed on a Siemens Vision scanner, are compared with a theoretical description of the gradient set, based on the manufacturer's spherical harmonic coefficients. It was found that over a volume of 320 × 200 × 340 mm3 distortions can be successfully mapped to within the voxel resolution of the raw imaging data, whilst outside this volume, correction is still good but some systematic errors are present. The phenomenon of through-plane distortion (also known as ‘slice warp’) is examined in detail, and the perturbation it causes to the measurements is quantified and corrected. At the very edges of the region of support provided by the phantom, through-plane distortion is extreme and only partially corrected by the present method. Solutions to this problem are discussed. Both phantom and patient data demonstrate the efficacy of the gradient warp correction.},

	abstract = {BackgroundMicrobeam and x-ray FLASH radiation therapy are innovative concepts that promise reduced normal tissue toxicity in radiation oncology without compromising tumor control. However, currently only large third-generation synchrotrons deliver acceptable x-ray beam qualities and there is a need for compact, hospital-based radiation sources to facilitate clinical translation of these novel treatment strategies. Purpose We are currently setting up the first prototype of a line-focus x-ray tube (LFxT), a promising technology that may deliver ultra-high dose rates (UHDRs) of more than 100 Gy/s from a table-top source. The operation of the source in the heat capacity limit allows very high dose rates with micrometer-sized focal spot widths. Here, we investigate concepts of effective heat management for the LFxT, a prerequisite for the performance of the source. Methods For different focal spot widths, we investigated the temperature increase numerically with Monte Carlo simulations and finite element analysis (FEA). We benchmarked the temperature and thermal stresses at the focal spot against a commercial x-ray tube with similar power characteristics. We assessed thermal loads at the vacuum chamber housing caused by scattering electrons in Monte Carlo simulations and FEA. Further, we discuss active cooling strategies and present a design of the rotating target. Results Conventional focal spot widths led to a temperature increase dominated by heat conduction, while very narrow focal spots led to a temperature increase dominated by the heat capacity of the target material. Due to operation in the heat capacity limit, the temperature increase at the focal spot was lower than for the investigated commercial x-ray tube. Hence, the thermal stress at the focal spot of the LFxT was considered uncritical. The target shaft and the vacuum chamber housing require active cooling to withstand the high heat loads. Conclusions The heat capacity limit allows very high power densities at the focal spot of the LFxT and thus facilitates very high dose rates. Numerical simulations demonstrated that the heat load imparted by scattering electrons requires active cooling.},

	abstract = {Purpose In radiation therapy, x-ray dose must be precisely sculpted to the tumor, while simultaneously avoiding surrounding organs at risk. This requires modulation of x-ray intensity in space and/or time. Typically, this is achieved using a multi leaf collimator (MLC)—a complex mechatronic device comprising over one hundred individually powered tungsten ‘leaves’ that move in or out of the radiation field as required. Here, an all-electronic x-ray collimation concept with no moving parts is presented, termed “SPHINX”: Scanning Pencil-beam High-speed Intensity-modulated X-ray source. SPHINX utilizes a spatially distributed bremsstrahlung target and collimator array in conjunction with magnetic scanning of a high energy electron beam to generate a plurality of small x-ray “beamlets.” Methods A simulation framework was developed in Topas Monte Carlo incorporating a phase space electron source, transport through user defined magnetic fields, bremsstrahlung x-ray production, transport through a SPHINX collimator, and dose in water. This framework was completely parametric, meaning a simulation could be built and run for any supplied geometric parameters. This functionality was coupled with Bayesian optimization to find the best parameter set based on an objective function which included terms to maximize dose rate for a user defined beamlet width while constraining inter-channel cross talk and electron contamination. Designs for beamlet widths of 5, 7, and 10 mm2 were generated. Each optimization was run for 300 iterations and took approximately 40 h on a 24-core computer. For the optimized 7-mm model, a simulation of all beamlets in water was carried out including a linear scanning magnet calibration simulation. Finally, a back-of-envelope dose rate formalism was developed and used to estimate dose rate under various conditions. Results The optimized 5–, 7–, and 10-mm models had beamlet widths of 5.1 , 7.2 , and 10.1 mm2 and dose rates of 3574, 6351, and 10 015 Gy/C, respectively. The reduction in dose rate for smaller beamlet widths is a result of both increased collimation and source occlusion. For the simulation of all beamlets in water, the scanning magnet calibration reduced the offset between the collimator channels and beam centroids from 2.9 ±1.9 mm to 0.01 ±0.03 mm. A slight reduction in dose rate of approximately 2\% per degree of scanning angle was observed. Based on a back-of-envelope dose rate formalism, SPHINX in conjunction with next-generation linear accelerators has the potential to achieve substantially higher dose rates than conventional MLC-based delivery, with delivery of an intensity modulated 100 × 100 mm2 field achievable in 0.9 to 10.6 s depending on the beamlet widths used. Conclusions Bayesian optimization was coupled with Monte Carlo modeling to generate SPHINX geometries for various beamlet widths. A complete Monte Carlo simulation for one of these designs was developed, including electron beam transport of all beamlets through scanning magnets, x-ray production and collimation, and dose in water. These results demonstrate that SPHINX is a promising candidate for sculpting radiation dose with no moving parts, and has the potential to vastly improve both the speed and robustness of radiotherapy delivery. A multi-beam SPHINX system may be a candidate for delivering magavoltage FLASH RT in humans.},

	abstract = {Simulated annealing has been widely used in the solution of optimization problems. As known by many researchers, the global optima cannot be guaranteed to be located by simulated annealing unless a logarithmic cooling schedule is used. However, the logarithmic cooling schedule is so slow that no one can afford to use this much CPU time. This article proposes a new stochastic optimization algorithm, the so-called simulated stochastic approximation annealing algorithm, which is a combination of simulated annealing and the stochastic approximation Monte Carlo algorithm. Under the framework of stochastic approximation, it is shown that the new algorithm can work with a cooling schedule in which the temperature can decrease much faster than in the logarithmic cooling schedule, for example, a square-root cooling schedule, while guaranteeing the global optima to be reached when the temperature tends to zero. The new algorithm has been tested on a few benchmark optimization problems, including feed-forward neural network training and protein-folding. The numerical results indicate that the new algorithm can significantly outperform simulated annealing and other competitors. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.},

Linear response surfaces are constructed in a subregion of the design space using a design of experiments approach with a D‐optimal experimental design. To converge to an optimum, a domain reduction scheme is utilized. The scheme requires only one user‐defined parameter, namely the size of the initial subregion. During optimization, the size of this region is adapted using a move reversal criterion to counter oscillation and a move distance criterion to gauge accuracy. To test its robustness, the results using the method are compared to SQP results of a selection of the well‐known Hock and Schittkowski problems. Although convergence to a small tolerance is slow when compared to SQP, the SRSM method does remarkably well for these sometimes pathological analytical problems. The second test concerns three engineering problems sampled from the nonlinear structural dynamics field to investigate the method's handling of numerical noise and non‐linearity. It is shown that, despite its simplicity, the SRSM method converges stably and is relatively insensitive to its only user‐required input parameter.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is gaining widespread use in radiation therapy planning, patient setup verification, and real-time guidance of radiation delivery. Successful implementation of these technologies relies on the development of simple and efficient methods to characterize and monitor the geometric distortions arising due to system imperfections and gradient nonlinearities. To this end, the authors present the theory and validation of a novel harmonic approach to the quantification of system-related distortions in MRI. Methods: The theory of spatial encoding in MRI is applied to demonstrate that the 3D distortion vector field (DVF) is given by the solution of a second-order boundary value problem (BVP). This BVP is comprised of Laplace's equation and a limited measurement of the distortion on the boundary of a specified region of interest (ROI). An analytical series expansion solving this BVP within a spherical ROI is obtained, and a statistical uncertainty analysis is performed to determine how random errors in the boundary measurements propagate to the ROI interior. This series expansion is then evaluated to obtain volumetric DVF mappings that are compared to reference data obtained on a 3 T full-body scanner. This validation is performed within two spheres of 20 cm diameter (one centered at the scanner origin and the other offset +3 cm along each of the transverse directions). Initially, a high-order mapping requiring measurements at 5810 boundary points is used. Then, after exploring the impact of the boundary sampling density and the effect of series truncation, a reduced-order mapping requiring measurements at 302 boundary points is evaluated. Results: The volumetric DVF mappings obtained from the harmonic analysis are in good agreement with the reference data. Following distortion correction using the high-order mapping, the authors estimate a reduction in the mean distortion magnitude from 0.86 to 0.42 mm and from 0.93 to 0.39 mm within the central and offset ROIs, respectively. In addition, the fraction of points with a distortion magnitude greater than 1 mm is reduced from 35.6\% to 2.8\% and from 40.4\% to 1.5\%, respectively. Similarly, following correction using the reduced-order mapping, the mean distortion magnitude reduces to 0.45–0.42 mm within the central and offset ROIs, and the fraction of points with a distortion magnitude greater than 1 mm is reduced to 2.8\% and 1.5\%, respectively. Conclusions: A novel harmonic approach to the characterization of system-related distortions in MRI is presented. This method permits a complete and accurate mapping of the DVF within a specified ROI using a limited measurement of the distortion on the ROI boundary. This technique eliminates the requirement to exhaustively sample the DVF at a dense 3D array of points, thereby permitting the design of simple, inexpensive phantoms that may incorporate additional modules for auxiliary quality assurance objectives.},

	abstract = {The aim of this work is to demonstrate a complete, robust, and time-efficient method for distortion correction of magnetic resonance (MR) images. It is well known that MR images suffer from both machine-related spatial distortions [gradient nonlinearity and main field inhomogeneity] and patient-related spatial distortions (susceptibility and chemical shift artifacts), and growing interest in the area of MR-based radiotherapy treatment planning has put new requirements on the geometric accuracy of such images. The authors present a two-step method that combines a phantom-based reverse gradient technique for measurement of gradient nonlinearities and a patient-based phase difference mapping technique for measurement of inhomogeneities, susceptibility, and chemical shift distortions. The phase difference mapping technique adds only minutes to the total patient scan time and can be used to correct a variety of images of the same patient and anatomy. The technique was tested on several different phantoms, each designed to isolate one type of distortion. The mean distortion was reduced to in both gradient echo and spin echo images of a grid phantom. For the more difficult case of a highly distorted echo planar image, residual distortion was reduced to subvoxel dimensions. As a final step, the technique was implemented on patient images. The current technique is effective, time efficient, and robust and provides promise for preparing distortion-rectified MR images for use in MR-based treatment planning.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we present the correction of the geometric distortion measured in the clinical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) systems reported in the preceding paper (Part I) using a 3D method based on the phantom-mapped geometric distortion data. This method allows the correction to be made on phantom images acquired without or with the vendor correction applied. With the vendor's 2D correction applied, the method corrects for both the “residual” geometric distortion still present in the plane in which the correction method was applied (the axial plane) and the uncorrected geometric distortion along the axis normal to the plane. The evaluation of the effectiveness of the correction using this new method was carried out through analyzing the residual geometric distortion in the corrected phantom images. The results show that the new method can restore the distorted images in 3D nearly to perfection. For all the MRI systems investigated, the mean absolute deviations in the positions of the control points (along x-, y- and z-axes) measured on the corrected phantom images were all less than 0.2 mm. The maximum absolute deviations were all below ∼0.8 mm. As expected, the correction of the phantom images acquired with the vendor's correction applied in the axial plane performed equally well. Both the geometric distortion still present in the axial plane after applying the vendor's correction and the uncorrected distortion along the z-axis have all been “restored.”},

Using this phantom, a full assessment of the geometric distortion in a number of clinical MRI systems (GE and Siemens) has been carried out and detailed results are presented in this paper. As expected, the main source of geometric distortion in modern superconducting MRI systems arises from the gradient field nonlinearity. Significantly large distortions with maximum absolute geometric errors ranged between 10 and 25 mm within a volume of 240×240×240 mm3 were observed when imaging with the new generation of gradient systems that employs shorter coils. By comparison, the geometric distortion was much less in the older-generation gradient systems. With the vendor's correction method, the geometric distortion measured was significantly reduced but only within the plane in which these 2D correction methods were applied. Distortion along the axis normal to the plane was, as expected, virtually unchanged. Two-dimensional correction methods are a convenient approach and in principle they are the only methods that can be applied to correct geometric distortion in a single slice or in multiple noncontiguous slices. However, these methods only provide an incomplete solution to the problem and their value can be significantly reduced if the distortion along the normal of the correction plane is not small.},

	abstract = {Objective  To correct for image distortions produced by standard Fourier reconstruction techniques on low field permanent magnet MRI systems with strong B0 inhomogeneity and gradient field nonlinearities. Materials and methods  Conventional image distortion correction algorithms require accurate ΔB0 maps which are not possible to acquire directly when the B0 inhomogeneities also produce significant image distortions. Here we use a readout gradient time-shift in a TSE sequence to encode the B0 field inhomogeneities in the k-space signals. Using a non-shifted and a shifted acquisition as input, ΔB0 maps and images were reconstructed in an iterative manner. In each iteration, ΔB0 maps were reconstructed from the phase difference using Tikhonov regularization, while images were reconstructed using either conjugate phase reconstruction (CPR) or model-based (MB) image reconstruction, taking the reconstructed field map into account. MB reconstructions were, furthermore, combined with compressed sensing (CS) to show the flexibility of this approach towards undersampling. These methods were compared to the standard fast Fourier transform (FFT) image reconstruction approach in simulations and measurements. Distortions due to gradient nonlinearities were corrected in CPR and MB using simulated gradient maps.},

	abstract = {Python has become the programming language of choice for research and industry projects related to data science, machine learning, and deep learning. Since optimization is an inherent part of these research fields, more optimization related frameworks have arisen in the past few years. Only a few of them support optimization of multiple conflicting objectives at a time, but do not provide comprehensive tools for a complete multi-objective optimization task. To address this issue, we have developed pymoo, a multi-objective optimization framework in Python. We provide a guide to getting started with our framework by demonstrating the implementation of an exemplary constrained multi-objective optimization scenario. Moreover, we give a high-level overview of the architecture of pymoo to show its capabilities followed by an explanation of each module and its corresponding sub-modules. The implementations in our framework are customizable and algorithms can be modified/extended by supplying custom operators. Moreover, a variety of single, multi- and many-objective test problems are provided and gradients can be retrieved by automatic differentiation out of the box. Also, pymoo addresses practical needs, such as the parallelization of function evaluations, methods to visualize low and high-dimensional spaces, and tools for multi-criteria decision making.

After a brief history of the MC method and popular codes in medical physics, we review applications of the MC method to model treatment heads for neutral and charged particle radiation therapy as well as specific in-room devices for imaging and therapy purposes. We conclude by discussing the impact that MCSs had in this field and the role of MC in future device design.},

The broad range of codes available is mentioned but there is special emphasis on the EGS4/EGSnrc code system which the author has helped develop for 25 years. The importance of the 1987 Erice Summer School on Monte Carlo techniques is highlighted. As an illustrative example of the role Monte Carlo techniques have played, the history of the correction for wall attenuation and scatter in an ion chamber is presented as it demonstrates the interplay between a specific problem and the development of tools to solve the problem which in turn leads to applications in other areas.},

	abstract = {Studies involving Monte Carlo simulations are common in both diagnostic and therapy medical physics research, as well as other fields of basic and applied science. As with all experimental studies, the conditions and parameters used for Monte Carlo simulations impact their scope, validity, limitations, and generalizability. Unfortunately, many published peer-reviewed articles involving Monte Carlo simulations do not provide the level of detail needed for the reader to be able to properly assess the quality of the simulations. The American Association of Physicists in Medicine Task Group \#268 developed guidelines to improve reporting of Monte Carlo studies in medical physics research. By following these guidelines, manuscripts submitted for peer-review will include a level of relevant detail that will increase the transparency, the ability to reproduce results, and the overall scientific value of these studies. The guidelines include a checklist of the items that should be included in the Methods, Results, and Discussion sections of manuscripts submitted for peer-review. These guidelines do not attempt to replace the journal reviewer, but rather to be a tool during the writing and review process. Given the varied nature of Monte Carlo studies, it is up to the authors and the reviewers to use this checklist appropriately, being conscious of how the different items apply to each particular scenario. It is envisioned that this list will be useful both for authors and for reviewers, to help ensure the adequate description of Monte Carlo studies in the medical physics literature.},

	abstract = {Ongoing debates surrounding Open Access to the scholarly literature are multifaceted and complicated by disparate and often polarised viewpoints from engaged stakeholders. At the current stage, Open Access has become such a global issue that it is critical for all involved in scholarly publishing, including policymakers, publishers, research funders, governments, learned societies, librarians, and academic communities, to be well-informed on the history, benefits, and pitfalls of Open Access. In spite of this, there is a general lack of consensus regarding the potential pros and cons of Open Access at multiple levels. This review aims to be a resource for current knowledge on the impacts of Open Access by synthesizing important research in three major areas: academic, economic and societal. While there is clearly much scope for additional research, several key trends are identified, including a broad citation advantage for researchers who publish openly, as well as additional benefits to the non-academic dissemination of their work. The economic impact of Open Access is less well-understood, although it is clear that access to the research literature is key for innovative enterprises, and a range of governmental and non-governmental services. Furthermore, Open Access has the potential to save both publishers and research funders considerable amounts of financial resources, and can provide some economic benefits to traditionally subscription-based journals. The societal impact of Open Access is strong, in particular for advancing citizen science initiatives, and leveling the playing field for researchers in developing countries. Open Access supersedes all potential alternative modes of access to the scholarly literature through enabling unrestricted re-use, and long-term stability independent of financial constraints of traditional publishers that impede knowledge sharing. However, Open Access has the potential to become unsustainable for research communities if high-cost options are allowed to continue to prevail in a widely unregulated scholarly publishing market. Open Access remains only one of the multiple challenges that the scholarly publishing system is currently facing. Yet, it provides one foundation for increasing engagement with researchers regarding ethical standards of publishing and the broader implications of 'Open Research'.},

	abstract = {In their seminal paper from 2014, Fauvadon et al. coined the term FLASH irradiation to describe ultra-high-dose rate irradiation with dose rates greater than 40 Gy/s, which results in delivery times of fractions of a second. The experiments presented in that paper were performed with a high-dose-per-pulse 4.5 MeV electron beam, and the results served as the basis for the modern-day field of FLASH radiation therapy (RT). In this article, we review the studies that have been published after those early experiments, demonstrating the robust effects of FLASH RT on normal tissue sparing in preclinical models. We also outline the various irradiation parameters that have been used. Although the robustness of the biological response has been established, the mechanisms behind the FLASH effect are currently under investigation in a number of laboratories. However, differences in the magnitude of the FLASH effect between experiments in different labs have been reported. Reasons for these differences even within the same animal model are currently unknown, but likely has to do with the marked differences in irradiation parameter settings used. Here, we show that these parameters are often not reported, which complicates large multistudy comparisons. For this reason, we propose a new standard for beam parameter reporting and discuss a systematic path to the clinical translation of FLASH RT.},

	abstract = {This work introduces an EGSnrc-based Monte Carlo (MC) beamlet does distribution matrix into a direct aperture optimization (DAO) algorithm for IMRT inverse planning. The technique is referred to as Monte Carlo–direct aperture optimization (MC-DAO). The goal is to assess if the combination of accurate Monte Carlo tissue inhomogeneity modeling and DAO inverse planning will improve the dose accuracy and treatment efficiency for treatment planning. Several authors have shown that the presence of small fields and/or inhomogeneous materials in IMRT treatment fields can cause dose calculation errors for algorithms that are unable to accurately model electronic disequilibrium. This issue may also affect the IMRT optimization process because the dose calculation algorithm may not properly model difficult geometries such as targets close to low-density regions (lung, air etc.). A clinical linear accelerator head is simulated using BEAMnrc (NRC, Canada). A novel in-house algorithm subdivides the resulting phase space into beamlets. Each beamlet is projected onto a patient-specific phantom. The beamlet dose contribution to each voxel in a structure-of-interest is calculated using DOSXYZnrc. The multileaf collimator (MLC) leaf positions are linked to the location of the beamlet does distributions. The MLC shapes are optimized using direct aperture optimization (DAO). A final Monte Carlo calculation with MLC modeling is used to compute the final dose distribution. Monte Carlo simulation can generate accurate beamlet dose distributions for traditionally difficult-to-calculate geometries, particularly for small fields crossing regions of tissue inhomogeneity. The introduction of DAO results in an additional improvement by increasing the treatment delivery efficiency. For the examples presented in this paper the reduction in the total number of monitor units to deliver is compared to fluence-based optimization methods.},

	abstract = {This paper addresses the solution of bound-constrained optimization problems using algorithms that require only the availability of objective function values but no derivative information. We refer to these algorithms as derivative-free algorithms. Fueled by a growing number of applications in science and engineering, the development of derivative-free optimization algorithms has long been studied, and it has found renewed interest in recent time. Along with many derivative-free algorithms, many software implementations have also appeared. The paper presents a review of derivative-free algorithms, followed by a systematic comparison of 22 related implementations using a test set of 502 problems. The test bed includes convex and nonconvex problems, smooth as well as nonsmooth problems. The algorithms were tested under the same conditions and ranked under several criteria, including their ability to find near-global solutions for nonconvex problems, improve a given starting point, and refine a near-optimal solution. A total of 112,448 problem instances were solved. We find that the ability of all these solvers to obtain good solutions diminishes with increasing problem size. For the problems used in this study, TOMLAB/MULTIMIN, TOMLAB/GLCCLUSTER, MCS and TOMLAB/LGO are better, on average, than other derivative-free solvers in terms of solution quality within 2,500 function evaluations. These global solvers outperform local solvers even for convex problems. Finally, TOMLAB/OQNLP, NEWUOA, and TOMLAB/MULTIMIN show superior performance in terms of refining a near-optimal solution.},

It enables high RF performance while maintaining low thermal losses. Copper is also responsible for some of the challenges: RF power output is often limited by the strength of copper and RF breakdown is induced by copper transformation at the vacuum surface. Recent advances in understanding of RF interaction with copper offer insight into its limitations and how they may be mitigated. Emerging manufacturing technologies, such as electron beam melting of copper, can be employed to achieve a stronger copper state in the RF structures, opening opportunities for higher power and more compact vacuum electronics. As copper focused additive manufacturing evolves, strengthening mechanisms can be incorporated into the material to produce desired material properties locally, further enhancing performance capabilities of vacuum devices.},

This new treatment facility is equipped with a 3D irradiation system with pencil-beam scanning. The challenge of this project is to realize treatment of a moving target by scanning irradiation. To achieve fast rescanning within an acceptable irradiation time, the authors developed a fast scanning system. Methods: In order to verify the validity of the design and to demonstrate the performance of the fast scanning prior to use in the new treatment facility, a new scanning-irradiation system was developed and installed into the existing HIMAC physics-experiment course. The authors made strong efforts to develop (1) the fast scanning magnet and its power supply, (2) the high-speed control system, and (3) the beam monitoring. The performance of the system including 3D dose conformation was tested by using the carbon beam from the HIMAC accelerator. Results: The performance of the fast scanning system was verified by beam tests. Precision of the scanned beam position was less than ±0.5 mm. By cooperating with the planning software, the authors verified the homogeneity of the delivered field within ±3\% for the 3D delivery. This system took only 20 s to deliver the physical dose of 1 Gy to a spherical target having a diameter of 60 mm with eight rescans. In this test, the average of the spot-staying time was considerably reduced to, while the minimum staying time was . Conclusions: As a result of this study, the authors verified that the new scanning delivery system can produce an accurate 3D dose distribution for the target volume in combination with the planning software.},

	abstract = {Purpose: We have experimentally characterized and simulated the dosimetric properties and spatial fidelity of a novel X-ray array source and collimation system called SPHINX that has the potential to generate complex intensity modulated X-ray beams by varying the electron beam intensity only, and without any moving parts like in multi-leaf collimators. Methods: We investigated the spatial fidelity and the X-ray performances of a SPHINX prototype in tungsten, using a Cyber Knife and the experimental high-energy electron beam line at XTA at SLAC National Laboratory. Dose distributions were recorded with gafchromic films, placed at the distal end of SPHINX and at several depths in a solid water phantom. The geometry of SPHINX and of the experimental set-ups was also modeled in Monte Carlo (MC) simulations with the FLUKA code, used to reproduce the experimental results and, after validation, to predict and optimize the performance and design of the SPHINX. Results: The results indicate significant particle leakage through the channels during a single-channel irradiation for high incident energies, followed by a rapid decrease for energies of clinical interest. When the collimator channels are used as target, the photon production increases, however at expense of the beam size that is also enlarged. The illumination of all channels simultaneously shows a fairly even transmission of the beam. Conclusion: With the measurements we have verified the MC models and the uniformity of beam transmission through SPHINX, and we have evaluated the importance of particle leakage through adjacent channels. These results can be used to optimize SPHINX design through the validated MC simulations.

	abstract = {Purpose: The details of a full simulation of an inline side-coupled 6 MV linear accelerator (linac) from the electron gun to the target are presented. Commissioning of the above simulation was performed by using the derived electron phase space at the target as an input into Monte Carlo studies of dose distributions within a water tank and matching the simulation results to measurement data. This work is motivated by linac-MR studies, where a validated full linac simulation is first required in order to perform future studies on linac performance in the presence of an external magnetic field. Methods: An electron gun was initially designed and optimized with a 2D finite difference program using Child's law. The electron gun simulation served as an input to a 6 MV linac waveguide simulation, which consisted of a 3D finite element radio-frequency field solution within the waveguide and electron trajectories determined from particle dynamics modeling. The electron gun design was constrained to match the cathode potential and electron gun current of a Varian 600C, while the linac waveguide was optimized to match the measured target current. Commissioning of the full simulation was performed by matching the simulated Monte Carlo dose distributions in a water tank to measured distributions. Results: The full linac simulation matched all the electrical measurements taken from a Varian 600C and the commissioning process lead to excellent agreements in the dose profile measurements. Greater than 99\% of all points met a 1\%/1mm acceptance criterion for all field sizes analyzed, with the exception of the largest field for which 98\% of all points met the 1\%/1mm acceptance criterion and the depth dose curves matched measurement to within 1\% deeper than 1.5 cm depth. The optimized energy and spatial intensity distributions, as given by the commissioning process, were determined to be non-Gaussian in form for the inline side-coupled 6 MV linac simulated. Conclusions: An integrated simulation of an inline side-coupled 6 MV linac has been completed and benchmarked matching all electrical and dosimetric measurements to high accuracy. The results showed non-Gaussian spatial intensity and energy distributions for the linac modeled.},
